## Plot
There was once a hamster named Mallet that lived on a hill and had a nifty hammer that he used to smash nuts. One day, a hawk came by and picked him up. The hawk, Tony, wanted to eat the hamster, but because Mallet had his trusty hammer, he was able to break free from Tonyâ€™s grasp, but unfortunately he landed in a far off location. Now, follow Mallet as he makes an epic journey back to his home, surviving the differing seasons and collecting food as he travels, all while still being attacked by Tony.

## Building on Linux
HHN can be built on Linux using the Makefile found in the Hamster-Hammers-Nuts source folder, but you will need the following libraries:
- libpng
- SDL 2.0
- SDL_mixer 2.0
- OpenGL

## Building on Windows
The Visual Studio solution in this directory is compatible with VS2015, and it references headers and libraries found in [kit-libs-win by ixchow](https://github.com/ixchow/kit-libs-win). Clone kit-libs-win to the same folder as the HHN root folder. 

\*\*If you want to debug HHN, you'll have to set the debugging working directory to the Assets folder.

## Happy Hammering!
